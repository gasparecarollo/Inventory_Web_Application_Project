Welcome to Gaspare's Unboxing Videos Webpage.

My webpage features a navigation menu bar that allows you to navigate through the Home page, Create-A-Box Page, Stream-A-Box Page, Services, and Shopping Cart.

Although you can maneuver through all the pages, focus your attention to the Home page for a cool graphic, and then navigate your way to the Buy-A-Box page.

In the Buy-A-Box page, there are onmouseover and onmouseout events that enable the user to hover over each Mystery Box revealing the contents of the mystery box. 

On the left side of the page we have an Inventory Form that allows Admin to input an Item Name, Price, and Stock availability.
